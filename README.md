# Python-GUI
Sample Python GUI project built using Tkinter.

## To-Do
The aim is to build a GUI using Tkinter to make a budget app, which can record information about the purchases made and track amount of money spent in different categories such as groceries, entertainment, maintainence etc, for each user.

So far, a simple login interface is made. Next step is to link it with SQL database inorder to hold purchase information and finally a page that visualizes the spending habits.
